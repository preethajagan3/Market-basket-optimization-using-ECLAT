**Market Basket Optimization using ECLAT
Overview**

This project implements Market Basket Analysis using the ECLAT (Equivalence Class Transformation) algorithm.
It identifies frequent itemsets from transactional data by using a vertical data format, making it efficient for mining associations.

The notebook is designed to run in Google Colab and can be adapted for Kaggle.

**Objective**

Discover frequently purchased item combinations

Apply the ECLAT algorithm for association rule mining

Analyze customer buying patterns

**Algorithm Used**

ECLAT Algorithm

Uses vertical data representation (item → transaction IDs)

Faster than Apriori for large datasets

Efficient frequent itemset mining

**Tools and Libraries**

Python

Google Colab

Pandas

itertools

**Dataset**

Transactional retail dataset

Each row represents a transaction

Each item represents a product bought

**Example:**

Milk,Bread,Butter
Bread,Diaper,Beer

**Steps Performed**

Load transaction dataset

Convert data into vertical format

Apply ECLAT algorithm

Generate frequent itemsets

Analyze support values

**Output**

Frequent itemsets with support values

Insights into commonly purchased products
